# Libft
The first project of the "42" school. Code a library of functions in C.

## Description
The first project of the "42" school.
The main goal of this project is to discorver different functions in C that we will use for future projects.
This project allows us to familiarize ourselves with the language.

*	List of the functions
	-	ft_atoi.c
	-	ft_bzero.c
	-	ft_calloc.c
	-	ft_isalnum.c
	-	ft_isalpha.c
	-	ft_isascii.c
	-	ft_isdigit.c
	-	ft_isprint.c
	-	ft_itoa.c
	-	ft_memccpy.c
	-	ft_memchr.c
	-	ft_memcmp.c
	-	ft_memcpy.c
	-	ft_memmove.c
	-	ft_memset.c
	-	ft_split.c
	-	ft_strchr.c
	-	ft_strdup.c
	-	ft_strjoin.c
	-	ft_strlcat.c
	-	ft_strlcpy.c
	-	ft_strlen.c
	-	ft_strmapi.c
	-	ft_strncmp.c
	-	ft_strnstr.c
	-	ft_strtrim.c
	-	ft_substr.c
	-	ft_tolower.c
	-	ft_toupper.c

###	What have I learned?
	-	Different types (int, char , unsigned ...).
	-	The given arguments and the return of a function.
	-	"const" keyword.
	-	Difference between "stack" and "heap"
	-	Use of "malloc" and "sizeof"
	-	Use of pointers (char *str)
	-	Use of Makefile

### What difficulties did I encounter?
As a nvice, my biggest difficulty was knowing where to start the project, which function.
In addition, we are learning a lot of new knowledge through this project.
One of the major difficulties that I may have had was in understanging how "malloc" works and how to use it.
